This is a collection of all of my notes and projects created in HTML, CSS, Javascript and other languages. Big projects, small learning projects, they are all here. I use a number of resources. 
This README was written on 12/21/2025 and will be updated slowly but surely with links to each topic I touch and point of my learning process, so enjoy and check out the links to my other projects below
