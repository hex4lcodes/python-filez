i took a very long break from doing anything Python or programming related due to work/life. Most of the code in the Basics folder was written in mid October to early November of 2025. It's
1/1/26 when Im writing this and its time to get back into the swing of things. Im going to do a C version of this but the c stuff will mostly be psuedocode for now.
The Python projects here are just refresher projects I planned to do on stream but, never did
