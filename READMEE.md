This is a collection of all of my notes and projects created in Python. Big projects, small learning projects, they are all here. I use a number of resources. This will mostly be projects with reminders in the comments portion, not many note files, if any
This README was written on 12/21/2025 and will be updated slowly but surely with links to each topic I touch and point of my learning process, which will be linked below
